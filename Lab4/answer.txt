Top-level containers:
    AWT: Top-level containers include Frame, Dialog, and Window in AWT.

    Swing: Top-level containers include JFrame, JDialog, and JWindow increase flexibility in Swing.


Class names of components:
    AWT: AWT components have simple class names, such as Button, Label, List, ...

    Swing: Swing components have names starting with "J"


Event handling:
    AWT: In AWT, event handling is typically done by implementing listener interfaces. The components register their listeners using methods like addActionListener, addMouseListener.

    Swing: Swing also uses listener interfaces for event handling,
    but it provides additional convenience classes such as AbstractAction and Action for handling actions.
    Swing components often have corresponding addListener methods


Resulting appearances:
    AWT: Appearance varies based on the underlying platform, resulting in different looks across operating systems.

    Swing: Provides consistent appearance across platforms due to its pluggable look and feel mechanism,
    offering options like "Metal", "Nimbus", "Windows", "GTK", etc.


Overall, Swing provides a more powerful and customizable framework for GUI development compared to AWT.
It offers a richer set of components, better event handling mechanisms, and more consistent appearance across different platforms.
However, AWT remains useful for simpler applications or for integration with existing AWT-based codebases.
