- Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
	+ Cart is aggregate of Media
	+ Store is aggregate of Media
	+ CompactDisc is aggregate of Track.
- Write constructors for parent and child classes. Remove redundant setter methods
	Already in the code

When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class,
you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes
as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the
passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

Answer: If the passed object is not an instance of Media, the equals() method returns false.
Book, CompactDisc and DigitalVideoDisc inherit Media, objects book, cd, dvd are also instances of Media. 
It will result in a ClassCastException at runtime. This can potentially crash your program.

- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?

Answers:
- Polymorphism provides many advantages such as:
    + Reusability: Polymorphism provides the reuse of code,
    as methods with the same name can be used in different classes.
    + Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for more flexible,
    where the behaviour of an object can change at runtime depending on the context
    in which it is being used.
    + Complexity reduction: It can reduce the complexity of code by allowing
    the use of the same method name for related functionality, making the code easier to read and maintain.
    + Coding simplification: Polymorphism simplifies coding by reducing the number of methods
    and constructors that need to be written.
    by grouping related functionality in one class.
    + Code Extensibility: Polymorphism enables code extensibility,
    as new subclasses can be created to extend the functionality of the superclass
    without modifying the existing code.
    + Efficiency increase: Compile-time polymorphism can lead to more efficient coding.
    The compiler can choose the appropriate method to call at compile time,
    based types, arguments passed to it.
- Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.

- The difference:
+ Inheritance:
    -Inheritance is one where a new class is created (derived class)
    that inherits the features from the already existing class(Base class).
    -support the concept of reusability and reduces code length in object-oriented programming.
    -single, hybrid, multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.
    -used in pattern designing.
+ Polymorphism:
    -Polymorphism is that which can be defined in multiple forms.
    -Applied to functions or methods in a basic way.
    -Allow the object to decide which form of the function to implement
    at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).
    -Whereas it can be compiled-time polymorphism (overload) as well as run-time polymorphism (overriding).
